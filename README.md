# Manim Livestream

This plugin is designed to emable livestreaming support for Manim. One
can easily open a terminal and type in:

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
python -m manim_livestream
```

## Installation

Works like other packages, so pip will do fine

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
pip install manim-livestream
```

### Contribution
Probably for unit testing where I have failed miserably. Any suggestions would 
be nice. As for more active contribution, I don't mind extra help. *Thanks even!*.
